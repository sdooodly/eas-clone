# eas-clone

I sketched out a plan to support my [etch-a-sketch](https://github.com/sdooodly/etch-a-sketch) application, but didn't want to shake things up too much. So, I drew up this separate repo and branched out to conduct some trials and errors. By creating a distinct repo, I avoided causing any "etch-idents" in the primary application. After completing my trials, I merged the changes back into the main application. It was an "etch-citing" journey, to say the least!

Toodles! (:
